# Elastic Detection rules

Our rules complements open-source Elastic threat detection rules to detect anomalies or suspicious events produced from the popular open-source components. Though this research is still in experimental phase, we are sharing rules for Nginx & Tomcat components with the Elastic community to obtain feedback and to add more intelligence to our engine. 

We are almost ready to share rules for few more components soon, stay tuned.
