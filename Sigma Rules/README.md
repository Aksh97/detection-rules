# Threat Detection 
These rules provides visibility for enterprises to quickly identify the attacks or attack attempts thus allowing a SOC analyst or first incident responders to easily prioritize the events and automate the further investigations. Upon diligent research we provide the threat detection patterns of all known exploits of a widely used components/software. 

# Anomaly Detection 
The idea behind these rules is to assist SOC analyst to prioritize the events stating which are related to security & non-security messages generated from the servers. This might also help in identifying undetected threats. These were generated by studying the output of our engine which was designed & capable to generate the rules of provided open-source components covering all the releases. 

# Active Exploits
These rules were generated by observing the exploits being weaponized on the Internet from our Honeypots deployed globally. These rules would not replace the rules of any IPS/IDS, in fact these rules were generated to get an insight of actively exploited vulnerabilities. 


Our research is still in the experimental phase, the rules provided can be altered as per your need.
